    This project takes glitches I found in my first attempted game with lua, and turns them into a unique glitch based game.
You start off on the left of the screen and keep moving right. There are special blocks that will either deter or help you,
and there are walls as well. Your objective is to get to the purple portal and beat the level. Each level is unique and randomly
generated.
